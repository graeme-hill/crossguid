# CrossGuid [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/graeme-hill/crossguid.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/graeme-hill/crossguid)

CrossGuid is a minimal, cross platform, C++ GUID library. It uses the best
native GUID/UUID generator on the given platform and has a generic class for
parsing, stringifying, and comparing IDs. The guid generation technique is
determined by your platform:

## Linux

On linux you can use `libuuid` which is pretty standard. On distros like Ubuntu
it is available by default but to use it you need the header files so you have
to do:

    sudo apt-get install uuid-dev

## Mac/iOS

On Mac or iOS you can use `CFUUIDCreate` from `CoreFoundation`. Since it's a
plain C function you don't even need to compile as Objective-C++.

## Windows

On Windows we just use the the built-in function `CoCreateGuid`. CMake can
generate a Visual Studio project if that's your thing.

## Android

The Android version uses a handle to a `JNIEnv` object to invoke the
`randomUUID()` function on `java.util.UUID` from C++. The Android specific code
is all in the `android/` subdirectory. If you have an emulator already running,
then you can run the `android.sh` script in the root directory. It has the
following requirements:

- Android emulator is already running (or you have physical device connected).
- You're using bash.
- adb is in your path.
- You have an Android sdk setup including `ANDROID_HOME` environment variable.

## Versions

This is version 0.2 of CrossGuid. If you all already using CrossGuid and your code
uses `GuidGenerator` then you are using version 0.1. Differences in version 0.2:

- Put everything inside the namespace `xg` instead of using the global
  namespace.
- Removed `GuidGenerator` class and replaced with the free function
  `xg::newGuid`. This is the way I originally wanted it to work but since Android
  is a special snowflake requiring state (`JNIEnv *`) I introduced the
  `GuidGenerator` class specifically so that there would be somewhere to store
  the `JNIEnv *` when running on Android. However, this basically meant
  complicating the library for the sake of one platform. In version 0.2 the goal is
  to design for the normal platforms and let Android be weird. In Android you just
  need to run `xg::initJni(JNIEnv *)` before you create any guids. The `JNIEnv *`
  is just stored as a global variable.
- Added CMake build system. Instead of different scripts for each platform you
  can just run cmake and it should handle each platform (except Android which
  again is special).
- Actual guid bytes are stored in `std::array<unsigned char, 16>` instead of
  `std::vector<unsigned char>`.
- More error checking (like if you try to create a guid with invalid number of
  bytes).

If you're happily using version 0.1 then there's not really any reason to
change.

## Compiling

Just do the normal cmake thing:

```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make install
```

The library can also be build with `c++17` by using `-DCMAKE_CXX_STANDARD=17` 
which enables `std::string_view` support.

## Running tests

After compiling as described above you should get two files: `libcrossguid.a` (the
static library) and `crossguid-test` (the test runner). So to run the tests just do:

```
./crossguid-test
```

## Basic usage

### Creating guids

Create a new random guid:

```cpp
#include <crossguid/guid.hpp>
...
auto g = xg::newGuid();
```

**NOTE:** On Android you need to call `xg::initJni(JNIEnv *)` first so that it
is possible for `xg::newGuid()` to call back into java libraries. `initJni`
only needs to be called once when the process starts.

Create a new zero guid:

```cpp
xg::Guid g;
```

Create from a string:

```cpp
xg::Guid g("c405c66c-ccbb-4ffd-9b62-c286c0fd7a3b");
```

### Checking validity

If you have some string value and you need to check whether it is a valid guid
then you can simply attempt to construct the guid:

```cpp
xg::Guid g("bad-guid-string");
if (!g.isValid())
{
	// do stuff
}
```

If the guid string is not valid then all bytes are set to zero and `isValid()`
returns `false`.

### Converting guid to string

First of all, there is normally no reason to convert a guid to a string except
for in debugging or when serializing for API calls or whatever. You should
definitely avoid storing guids as strings or using strings for any
computations. If you do need to convert a guid to a string, then you can
utilize strings because the `<<` operator is overloaded. To print a guid to
`std::cout`:

```cpp
void doGuidStuff()
{
    auto myGuid = xg::newGuid();
    std::cout << "Here is a guid: " << myGuid << std::endl;
}
```

Or to store a guid in a `std::string`:

```cpp
void doGuidStuff()
{
    auto myGuid = xg::newGuid();
    std::stringstream stream;
    stream << myGuid;
    auto guidString = stream.str();
}
```

There is also a `str()` function that returns a `std::string`:

```cpp
std::string guidStr = xg::newGuid().str();
```

### Creating a guid from raw bytes

It's unlikely that you will need this, but this is done within the library
internally to construct a `Guid` object from the raw data given by the system's
built-in guid generation function. There are two key constructors for this:

```cpp
Guid(std::array<unsigned char, 16> &bytes);
```

and

```cpp
Guid(const unsigned char * bytes);
```

When possible prefer the `std::array` constructor because it is safer. If you
pass in an incorrectly sized C array then bad things will happen.

### Comparing guids

`==` and `!=` are implemented, so the following works as expected:

```cpp
void doGuidStuff()
{
    auto guid1 = xg::newGuid();
    auto guid2 = xg::newGuid();

    auto guidsAreEqual = guid1 == guid2;
    auto guidsAreNotEqual = guid1 != guid2;
}
```

### Hashing guids

Guids can be used directly in containers requireing `std::hash` such as `std::map,`std::unordered_map` etc.
